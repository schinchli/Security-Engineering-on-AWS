This is sensitive data that needs to be encrypted using AWS KMS.
It could represent customer PII, financial records, health information,
or any data requiring protection at rest.

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) provides centralized control over
cryptographic keys used to protect your data. KMS integrates with
AWS services and your own applications to provide consistent
encryption and key management across your entire infrastructure.

Sample sensitive data fields:
- Customer ID: CUST-12345-ABCDE
- Account Number: ****-****-****-1234
- SSN: ***-**-6789
- API Key: sk_live_*******************

This data should never be stored in plaintext in production systems.
Always use KMS encryption for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.
